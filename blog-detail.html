      <h1>How DeepSeek Works: An Accessible Overview</h1>
      <h3>Introduction: What is DeepSeek and Why Does It Matter?</h3>
      <p>
        Imagine a new generation of artificial intelligence (AI) that's not only incredibly smart but also surprisingly efficient. That's the promise of DeepSeek, a series of advanced AI systems developed with a clever approach. These AI models are designed to understand and generate human-like text, write computer code, solve math problems, and much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes DeepSeek special is its ability to achieve top-tier performance, comparable to some of the most well-known AI models, but often at a lower cost to build and run. This opens up exciting possibilities for businesses and developers.
      </p>

      <h2>The Challenge: Building Powerful AI Can Be Expensive and Complex</h2>
      <p>
        DeepSeek tackles this challenge by combining proven AI architecture with innovative efficiency techniques.
        Think of it like building a high-performance race car: you start with a solid, well-tested engine design, but then you add cutting-edge improvements to make it faster and more fuel-efficient.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Building on a Solid Foundation</h2>
      <p>
        DeepSeek models are built upon a popular and reliable AI structure similar to what's known as the "Llama" architecture. This means they use established methods for processing information and learning from data. Key aspects include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Core Design:</strong> They use a decoder-only transformer stack, a common and effective way to build language models. This includes standard components like RMSNorm for stable learning, SwiGLU for efficient processing, and Rotary Position Encodings (RoPE) to understand word order over long texts (up to 4,096 "tokens" or pieces of words).</li>
        <li><strong>Smarter Attention:</strong> For its larger models, DeepSeek uses an advanced technique called Grouped-Query Attention (GQA). This helps the AI focus its "attention" more efficiently, reducing the amount of memory needed and speeding up calculations without significantly sacrificing quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Better Vocabulary:</strong> DeepSeek employs a large vocabulary (around 102,000 tokens) that effectively covers both English and Chinese, allowing for better understanding and generation in these languages.</li>
      </ul>
